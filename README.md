<b>Coursemanager</b>

A mobile app created using Xamarin Forms used to track Terms, Courses and Assessments for a college degree program.

I self-learned Xamarin by taking two pluralsight courses:

	https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/xamarin-forms-applications-xaml
	https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/data-binding-xamarin-forms
	
... and then created this in about 2 weeks.

I attempted to take a stab at MVVM with this but dont think I fully got it. The add/edit code is a little wacky.
